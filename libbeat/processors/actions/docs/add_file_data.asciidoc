The `add_file_data` processor adds file format specific data based
off of a file at a given path in `field`. If the processor
supports the file's file type, the extracted information is added
under the `target` field with a sub-key based off of the type. The
supported file types are `pe`, `macho`, `elf`, and `lnk`.

`field`:: Use the given field as a file path.
`target`:: Use the given field as the location for dumping the file data.
`exclude`:: Exclude the specified file parsers.
`only`:: Use only the specified file parsers.
`pattern`:: Only attempt to parse files that match the given regex.
`ignore_failure`:: No-op if the file could not successfully be parsed.
